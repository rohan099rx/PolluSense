# üéØ Forecast 2025 Update

## Summary
Updated the PolluSense dashboard to display predictions for **2025** dates, even though training data only extends to June 2024.

## Problem
- Training data available: **July 2019 to June 30, 2024**
- User requested: **Predictions for October 2025**
- Previous behavior: Forecasts could only start from dates within the training period

## Solution

### 1. **Pattern-Based History Extension**
Modified `compute_forecast()` function in `web/app.py` to automatically extend historical data when the requested start date is beyond the training period.

**How it works:**
```python
# If forecast start date > last training date:
# 1. Calculate gap in hours
# 2. Use last 168 hours (1 week) as repeating pattern
# 3. Cyclically extend history to reach requested date
# 4. Recalculate lag features for extended data
```

### 2. **User Interface Enhancement**
Added information display in sidebar showing:
- Training data date range
- Note about pattern extension for future dates

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

**File: `web/app.py`**

#### Change 1: Extended `compute_forecast()` function
```python
@st.cache_data
def compute_forecast(_models_bundle, history_df, start_ts, steps, features):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # NEW: If start_ts is beyond history, extend it
    last_hist_date = hist.index[-1]
    if start_ts > last_hist_date:
        hours_to_extend = int((start_ts - last_hist_date).total_seconds() / 3600)
        
        # Use last week's pattern cyclically
        pattern_length = min(168, len(hist))
        pattern = hist.iloc[-pattern_length:].copy()
        
        # Create extended rows
        extended_rows = []
        for i in range(hours_to_extend):
            new_idx = last_hist_date + pd.Timedelta(hours=i+1)
            pattern_idx = i % pattern_length
            new_row = pattern.iloc[pattern_idx].copy()
            new_row.name = new_idx
            extended_rows.append(new_row)
        
        # Append and recalculate features
        extended_df = pd.DataFrame(extended_rows)
        hist = pd.concat([hist, extended_df])
        hist = add_past_target_features(hist, ['O3_target', 'NO2_target'])
```

#### Change 2: Added date range info in sidebar
```python
# Show training data range
hist_df_temp = load_history_parquet(train_csv)
train_start = hist_df_temp.index[0]
train_end = hist_df_temp.index[-1]

st.sidebar.info(f'üìä Training data: {train_start.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")} to {train_end.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}')
st.sidebar.caption('Dates beyond training period use cyclical pattern extension.')
```

## Usage

### Running Predictions for 2025

1. **Open Dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run web/app.py
   ```

2. **Set Forecast Parameters:**
   - Start date: **Any date in 2025** (e.g., October 15, 2025)
   - Start time: **Any hour** (e.g., 00:00)
   - Horizon: **24h or 48h**

3. **Click "Run Forecast"**
   - Dashboard will automatically extend history using weekly patterns
   - Generate predictions starting from your selected 2025 date
   - Display results in charts and tables

### What You'll See

```
üìä Training data: 2019-07-14 to 2024-06-30
    Dates beyond training period use cyclical pattern extension.
```

## Assumptions & Limitations

### ‚úÖ What Works Well
- Short to medium-term forecasts (24-48 hours)
- Seasonal patterns remain similar to 2024
- Weather and pollution patterns follow historical cycles

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
1. **Pattern Extension**: Uses last week of training data cyclically
   - Good for: General patterns, time-of-day effects
   - May miss: Long-term trends, policy changes, new developments

2. **Prediction Accuracy**: 
   - Most accurate for dates close to training period (July-Dec 2024)
   - Accuracy may decrease for dates far into 2025
   - Model doesn't know about 2025-specific events

3. **Better Alternatives** (if needed):
   - Retrain model with more recent data
   - Use seasonal decomposition for better pattern extraction
   - Incorporate external data sources (weather forecasts, policy changes)

## Performance Impact

- **Computation Time**: Slightly longer for far-future dates (adds pattern extension step)
- **Memory**: Minimal increase (pattern is only 168 hours)
- **Cache**: Streamlit caching still works efficiently

## Example Output

**Forecast Request:**
- Start: October 15, 2025, 00:00
- Horizon: 24 hours

**Result:**
- History extended from 2024-06-30 to 2025-10-15 using weekly patterns
- Predictions generated for Oct 15-16, 2025
- Charts display O‚ÇÉ and NO‚ÇÇ forecasts with proper 2025 dates

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Pattern Extension:**
   - Seasonal averaging instead of simple cycling
   - Trend extrapolation for long-term changes
   - Weather forecast integration

2. **Data Updates:**
   - Add 2024-2025 data when available
   - Retrain models quarterly

3. **User Feedback:**
   - Add confidence intervals for extended forecasts
   - Show "extrapolation warning" for very distant dates

## Files Modified

- `web/app.py` - Updated forecast computation and UI

## Testing

Tested scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Date within training period (2024-01-01)
- ‚úÖ Date just after training (2024-07-01)
- ‚úÖ Date far in future (2025-10-15)
- ‚úÖ 24h and 48h horizons
- ‚úÖ Different times of day

## Conclusion

The dashboard now successfully generates forecasts for **any date in 2025**, using intelligent pattern extension to bridge the gap between training data (ending June 2024) and the requested forecast date. While accuracy is highest for dates close to the training period, the approach provides reasonable predictions based on historical patterns.
